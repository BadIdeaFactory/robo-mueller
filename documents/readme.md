# Documents from the Special Counsel's Office

All of the documents in this directory have been downloaded from [the Special Counsel Office's website](https://www.justice.gov/sco).

@knowtheory will also investigate if there are further documents that may have been filed with courts but not on this website.  Either Brad Heath's Big Case's bot may have uploaded some to DocumentCloud, or Buzzfeed may have additional documents on DocumentCloud.
