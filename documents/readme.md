# Documents from the Special Counsel's Office

All of the documents in this directory have been downloaded from [the Special Counsel Office's website](https://www.justice.gov/sco).

[knowtheory][] will also investigate if there are further documents that may have been filed with courts but not on this website.  Either [Brad Heath][]'s [Big Cases] bot may have [uploaded some to DocumentCloud](https://www.documentcloud.org/search/Account:%20149-brad-heath%20"Mueller,%20III"), or [Buzzfeed may have additional documents on DocumentCloud](https://www.documentcloud.org/search/Group:%20buzzfeed%20Text:%20%22Mueller,%20III%22).
